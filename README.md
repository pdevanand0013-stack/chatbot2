### 📝 Abstract
This project is a sophisticated AI-powered chatbot designed to streamline the admission process for Sreepathy Institute of Management and Technology (SIMAT). Unlike traditional static chatbots, this system employs **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user intent, handles multi-turn conversations for complex queries (like fees), and integrates **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to verify student eligibility documents in real-time. It features a fully responsive, modern UI with voice interaction capabilities, making it accessible and user-friendly for students and parents.
